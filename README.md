RRT

Python RRT algorithm with visualization, kinodynamic constraints and other optimizations/extensions

The Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is very useful for Path/Motion Planning in robotic systems. This algorithm is a fast probabilistic method of searching a configuration space, and works for both holonomic and non-holonomic systems. This project is a python program that builds a RRT with or without constraints, and displays the tree/path generation in real time.

Here is an example of the program's output
